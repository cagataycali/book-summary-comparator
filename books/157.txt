The Balkan Wars (1911- 1913)

The Region
                    Balkan is a Turkish word meaning mountain. The Balkan mountains form part of the border between Bulgaria and Macedonia.  These mountains run through the center of Bulgaria <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('uzanmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;"onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> stretching </b></a> to the Black Sea.  This word has been <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('birleşmek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> associated </b></a> with the region since the early 19th century. The <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('yarımada','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> peninsula </b></a> was split into two main <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc(' mezhep','IELZ HELP:'); return true;"onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> sects </b></a>.The Slav countries of Bulgaria and Serbia and the non-Slav countries of Greece and Romania.  In the Balkans, Christians were of Eastern Orthodox <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('inanç','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> faith </b></a> and greatly were in fear of <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('egemenlik','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> domination </b></a> by Catholics. <br><br>
The Rule
                    The Balkans were lands that had been part of the Roman Empire <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('yönetmek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> ruled </b></a> by Constatinople.  At the end of the 14th century Ottoman Turks <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc(' istila etmek ','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> invaded </b></a> the Balkans and ruled for 500 years. The <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('antlaşma','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> Treaty </b></a> of Berlin, which ended the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, made Serbia, <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('Karadağ','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> Montenegro </b>
</a>, and Romania independent.  The <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('prenslik','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> principality </b></a> of Bulgaria was created as well.  Austria-Hungary kept control of both Slovenia and Croatia. <br><br>
The Beginning
                    In 1908-1909, Turkey was <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('meşgul olmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> engaged in </b></a> what is known as the <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('Jön Türkler Devrimi','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> Young Turks Revolution </b></a>, a revolution fought to <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('yeniden elde etmek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> regain </b></a> democracy in the Ottoman Empire. On the curtails of this revolution, in 1908, Russia secretly <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('bahşetmek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> granted </b></a> Bosnia and Herzegovina to Austria.  This almost <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('patlak vermek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> erupted </b></a> in war with Serbia and nearly began the first World War. With the Italo-Turkish War occurring during 1911-1912  over <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('egemenlik','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> possession </b></a> of Tripoli, the Balkan states became restless. Seeing the <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('ilhak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> annexation </b></a> of  Bosnia and Herzegovina only strengthened Serbia's nationalism and the first World War  was <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('aşağıya yönelmiş','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> downcast </b></a> to tensions that would remain high in the Balkans and eventually lead to a large scale war. <br><br>
First Balkan War

                    While the revolution in Turkey and the Italo-Turkish war fed the Balkans need to <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('misilleme yapmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> retaliate </b></a> against the Turks. The first World War  was downcast to tensions that would remain high in the Balkans and eventually lead to a large scale war all the while leading into the First Balkan War. The Italo-Turkish War had encouraged the Balkans to expand their <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('alan','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> territory </b></a>. An <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('ittifak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> alliance </b></a> made up of Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro was formed to serve as "a response to the <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('baskıcı','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> repressive </b></a> policies of the Young Turks." <br><br>
            
                     Serbia and Bulgaria signed a treaty on March 13, 1912 which <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('paylaşmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> split </b></a> Macedonia in half giving both countries equal portions. With the aid of Russian secret diplomacy, this treaty divided all their possible <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('fetih','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> conquests </b></a> and provided <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('müşterek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> joint </b></a> military action. Source Montenegro entered the so called alliance through an informal arrangement with Greece and Bulgaria which turned into a treaty with Serbia in September of 1912. Earlier in May, Greece and Bulgaria allied by signing a treaty similar to the one between Serbia and Bulgaria. <br><br>

                    "On October 8, 1912, Montenegro declared war against the Turks , and 10 days later the <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('müttefik ülke','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> allies </b></a> entered the war. "The Turks were quickly driven from Eastern Turkey and remained only in Constantinople. Forces captured western Macedonia and Kosovo while Serbia moved through Albania to secure a port on the Adriatic Sea at Durazzo. Serbia had intentions of annexing a great deal of Albania to secure their port. Neither Austria nor Italy liked the thought of a Serbian sea port on the Adriatic. They were fearful that this port would become a Russian port. <br><br>

                    The Turks <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('dava açmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> sued </b></a> for an <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('ateşkes','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> armistice </b></a> in late November and by December 3 the agreement had been signed by all the Balkan allies except Greece. Greece continued its actions against the Turks. Later in December, the European powers met in London to decide what needed to be done in the Balkans. With the capture of a sea port by Serbia on the Adriatic in Albania, Austria-Hungary immediately convinced the powers that Albania should be granted its independence. Albania was <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('hakikaten','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> indeed </b></a> awarded its independence and Serbia was forced to remove its troops from the country. An <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('yıkılma','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> overthrow </b></a> of the government in Istanbul occurred which broke up these <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('görüşme','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> negotiations </b></a>. The men who took over power in Istanbul were bent on <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('direnme','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> resistance </b></a>. The peace conditions that were decided at in the conference in London were rejected by the Turks and, unfortunately, fighting resumed in a week, the conference ended and no end of the war had been found. <br><br>

                    Finally, on May 20 the conference in London resumed. On May 30, by the Treaty of London, the First Balkan War ended. The Turks were forced to give up Crete to Greece .They were also forced to give up lands to Europe around the Aegean Sea. The Treaty awarded Serbia almost all that remained in Europe of the Ottoman lands. The war had resulted in the liberation of the Old Serbia region. Possession of Albania and the Aegean Islands remained unclear and instead these lands were referred to an international commission. Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. "The Treaty followed with a <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('anlaşmazlık','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> quarrel </b></a> over the spoils of war" and leads into the Second Balkan War." <br><br>
Second Balkan War
                       <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('çatışma','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> Conflict </b></a> began immediately over how Macedonia was divided. Neither Greece nor Serbia nor Bulgaria was in possession of the section of Macedonia that they wanted. Greece was in possession of Salonika which Bulgaria wanted while Serbia was in possession of Monastir which Bulgaria claimed as its own. The three countries remained at odds until the Czar of All the Russias stepped in. The Czar offered to act as the <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('tarafsız aracı','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> arbitrator </b></a> in their <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('anlaşmazlık','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> disputes </b></a> and the countries <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('kabul etmek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> submitted </b></a> to the <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('arabulucu kararıyla halletme','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> arbitration </b></a>.<br><br>

                    Greece and Serbia, however, allied against Bulgaria on June 1, 1913. On June 29, a Bulgarian general, acting without orders, led an attack on Serbian defensive positions.Bulgaria, of course, did not claim responsibility for the attack so, Serbia and Greece declared war on July 8. Montenegro, Romania, and the Ottoman Empire all entered the war against Bulgaria within weeks of its beginning. Bulgaria was defeated. "On July 30, Bulgaria, unable to <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('direnmek','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> withstand </b></a> this coalition, asked for and received an armistice. "<br><br>
                         The peace agreement was signed in Bucharest on August 10. Bulgarian land possessions were <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('dağıtmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> scattered </b></a> away to different countries. Romania received one of the largest portions measuring almost 3000 square miles. Macedonia, for the most part, was awarded to Serbia and Greece. The Turks, having taken advantage of Bulgarias situation, recovered Adrianople and was awarded other large territories. This <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('bozgun','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> defeat </b></a> of Bulgaria assured that it had no possibility of participating in a South Slav state. "<br><br>
                    The Second Balkan War left Serbia on somewhat of an ego trip. Serbia doubled in size due to Montenegro now being considered a common <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('sınır','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> frontier </b></a>. Now full of confidence, it was driven by a desire to annex parts of Austria-Hungary. However, the wars had weakened the country. Macedonian and Albanian <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('azınlık','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> minorities </b></a> were left with <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('sert','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> bitter </b></a> <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('kızgınlık','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> resentment </b></a> towards Serbia, and an anti-Serbian <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('duygu','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> sentiment </b></a> was held by Austria-Hungary. Serbia's hope for an <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('çıkış yeri','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> outlet </b></a> to the sea was demolished when Greece <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('almak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> obtained </b></a> coastal Macedonia. <br><br>

<a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('kötü sonuç','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> Aftermath </b></a>

                       What had begun in a few short wars fought over 1912-1913, lead to a War of the Worlds no one would soon forget. "Ethnic <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('nefret','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> hatred </b></a>, religious rivalry, language <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('engel','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> barriers </b></a>, and cultural conflicts" <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('sıkmak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> plague </b></a> the kingdom to this day. These Balkan Wars were only the beginning of decades of wars that would <a HREF="23113.htm" onMouseOver="drc('tekrarlamak','IELZ HELP:'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;"><b> echo </b></a> throughout the Balkans. <br><br>
